Music Recommendation System: Utilizing K-means Algorithm for Enhanced Music
Discovery
The rapid growth of digital music platforms has led to an overwhelming amount of
music available to users, making it increasingly challenging to discover new and
relevant songs. To address this issue, we present a Music Recommendation System
(MRS) that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized
music suggestions, aiming to enhance the user experience and improve music
discovery.
With the abundance of music available in today's digital landscape, the task of
discovering new and relevant songs has become increasingly challenging for users.
In this project, we propose a Music Recommendation System (MRS) that leverages
the power of the K-means algorithm to provide personalized music suggestions,
enhancing the user experience and facilitating music exploration.
The core of our MRS lies in the application of the K-means algorithm, a popular
unsupervised learning technique, to cluster songs based on their audio features. By
extracting audio features such as tempo, rhythm, melody, and timbre from a vast
music dataset, we create a multidimensional space in which songs are represented.
The K-means algorithm is then employed to partition these songs into distinct
clusters, with each cluster containing songs that share similar audio characteristics.
To generate personalized music recommendations, our system utilizes a two-step
process. In the first step, we identify the cluster to which a user's preferred songs
belong by comparing their audio features to the centroids of the song clusters. This
allows us to understand the user's musical preferences in terms of the identified
clusters. In the second step, we recommend songs from the clusters that align with
the user's preferences, thereby providing a tailored and personalized music selection.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MRS, we conducted extensive experiments on a
diverse music dataset, encompassing various genres and artist styles. The results
demonstrate that our system successfully clusters songs based on their audio features,
and the recommendations generated through the K-means algorithm show a high
degree of relevance to users' preferences.
In conclusion, our Music Recommendation System utilizes the K-means algorithm to
improve the music discovery process. By clustering songs based on audio features,
we create a personalized recommendation system that enables users to explore and
discover music that aligns with their individual tastes.
